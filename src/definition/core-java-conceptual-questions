explain the entire java life cycle.
Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when we type source code in a text editor to
the point that source code is converted into machine code (0’s and 1’s).
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:
Editing the program
Compiling the source code
Executing the byte code
First, you will start with typing the program in a text-editor (ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc).
After completing editing of the program, we have to save the file. While saving the file you should remember that the
file must be saved with .java extension. For example, let’s think that I had written a Java program which contains a
single class Sample (more on classes in future posts). It is a good convention to save the file with the name of the
class. So, as per my example, the file will be saved as Sample.java.
Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code which
is available in Sample.java. The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is
known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file. As per my example, the bytecode file
will be Sample.class.
Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to
the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.


what is class?
In object-oriented programming , a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of
 object . Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.


What is object?
In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are
 also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. ... Each object is an instance of a particular
 class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.


What is the entry point of an object?
In computer programming, an entry point is where the first instructions of a program are executed, and where the program
has access to command line arguments. To start a program's execution, the loader or operating system passes control to
 its entry point.


Why main is static?
Search Results
Featured snippet from the web
Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static allows main to be called without creating an
 object of the class in which the main method is defined. ... In this case, main must be declared as public , since it
must be called by code outside of its class when the program is started.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object is the super class of all other classes you use, including the ones you implemented. And you'll see the following
 methods are inherited from Object in every class. java.lang.Object is a super class of any class by default. The root
 class of the Java class hierarchy.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an
 environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract
class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior. Variables declared in a Java interface is by
default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables


what is Access Specifier?
As the name suggests access Spicifiers in Java helps to restrict the scope of a class, constructor , variable , method or
 data member.Access modifiers are a specific part of programming language syntax used to facilitate the encapsulation of
components.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
The Objects Oriented programming language supports all the features of normal programming languages. In addition it
 supports some important concepts and terminology which has made it popular among programming methodology.
The important features of Object Oriented programming are:
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Data Hiding
Encapsulation
Overloading
Reusability


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
java.lang package is imported by default, no need to explicitly import it. Classes in the java.lang package do not need
to be imported (the compiler acts like they are always imported)


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Depending on the data transfer formats used in request-response messaging, web APIs are classified as SOAP (Simple
 Object Access Protocol), RPC (Remote Procedure Call), and REST (Representational State Transfer). These are the
different protocols through which exchange of information takes place over web.first is jason.parser, second is mongodb.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
java does not support multiple inheritances through classes but through the interfaces, we can use multiple inheritances
 . No java doesn't support multiple inheritance directly because it leads to overriding of methods when both extended
class have a same method name.
Yes,java can support multiple inheritance.But not using class it can be supported using interface. No ,java do not
support multiple inheritance because of diamond problem. No, java doesn't Supports Multiple Inheritance because of
ambiguity error.


What is method overloading and when it happens?Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than
one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different. It is similar to constructor overloading in
Java, that allows a class to have more than one constructor having different argument lists.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception object is an instance of an exception class. It gets created and handed to the Java runtime when an
 exceptional event occurred that disrupted the normal flow of the application. This is called “to throw an exception”
because in Java you use the keyword “throw” to hand the exception to the runtime.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested
classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. Basically, static is used
 for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
final keyword is used in different contexts. First of all, final is a non-access modifier applicable only to a variable,
 a method or a class. Following are different contexts where final is used. When a variable is declared with final
 keyword, its value can't be modified, essentially, a constant.
final (Java) In the Java programming language, the final keyword is used in several contexts to define an entity that
can only be assigned once. Once a final variable has been assigned, it always contains the same value


What is final, finally and finalize?
Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. Finally is
 used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finalize is used to perform
 clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. 2) Final is a keyword.finally is a block.Finalize is a
 method.

What is a constructor ?
In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object.
It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically
 provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor. ... If the parent has no constructor ( Object does
have one), the compiler will reject the program.


What is "this" keyword in java ?this is a keyword in Java. It can be used inside the method or constructor of a class.
 this works as a reference to the current object, whose method or constructor is being invoked. This keyword can be used
 to refer to any member of the current object from within an instance method or a constructor.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent . We could access maxSpeed of base class
 in sublcass using super keyword.
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine.


Is JVM platform independent?
no


What version of java are you using?
java version "1.8.0_121"


What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many
 files into one.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
 JDK is for development purpose whereas JRE is for running the java programs. JDK and JRE both contains JVM so that we
 can run our java program. JVM is the heart of java programming language and provides platform independence.


What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
The JRE is the environment within which the virtual machine runs. JRE is the container, JVM is the content. Java Runtime
 Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files. It does not contain any development tools such
  as compiler, debugger, etc.


What is compile time and run time?
Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development.
Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance
 where the executable is running. ... Compile-time checking occurs during the compile time


What is heap?
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of
two types: Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of
it's children.


How java manage it's memory?
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuider are mutable classes. StringBuffer is thread safe and
synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not, thats why StringBuilder is more faster than StringBuffer. String concat +
 operator internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class


What is Singleton class?
The singleton design pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the
 class exists in the JVM. In other words, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the
  class) at a time per JVM instance.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse
 process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist
 the object.


when to use transient variable in java?
The Java transient keyword is used on class attributes/variables to indicate that serialization process of such class
should ignore such variables while creating a persistent byte stream for any instance of that class. A transient
 variable is a variable that can not be serialized.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
while loop check condition before iteration of the loop. On the other hand, the do-while loop verifies the condition
after the execution of the statements inside the loop. Furthermore,the while loop is known as the entry-controlled loop.
on the other hand do while loop is known as the exit controlled loop.


What is Enum?
 An enum is a user-defined type consisting of a set of named constants called enumerators. The colors of the rainbow
 would be mapped like this.: Now internally, the compiler will use an int to hold these and if no values are supplied,
red will be 0, orange is 1 etc.


What is Iterator?
An iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java Collections Framework.Iterators allow
 the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics. Method
 names have been improved.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
integer


Why is String Immutable in Java?
The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool. ... Another reason of why String class
 is immutable could die due to HashMap. Since Strings are very popular as HashMap key, it's important for them to be
 immutable so that they can retrieve the value object which was stored in HashMap


What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
 Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors
 in same class.


The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
1) the parallel uses multiple GC threads, while the CMS uses only one.
2) the parallel is a 'stop-the-world' collector, while the CMS stops the world only during the initial mark and remark
phases.during the concurrent marking and sweeping phases, the CMS thread runs along with the application's threads.


What is JIT stands for?
just in time.


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. Whenever we create any object,
it's always created in the Heap space. Garbage Collection runs on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects
 that doesn't have any reference.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while
 heap memory is used to store objects in Java. No matter, where the object is created in code e.g. as a member variable,
local variable or class variable,  they are always created inside heap space in Java.



What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the
 names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time. It is also possible to instantiate new objects, invoke methods and
  get/set field values using reflection.


what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. A thread is a lightweight sub-process,
 the smallest unit of processing.


What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource with multiple threads in
Java. Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same
 lock simultaneously or concurrently.


What is Framework?
Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of prewritten code to which you add your own code to solve a problem
 in a specific domain. ... You make use of a framework by calling its methods, inheritance, and supplying "callbacks",
 listeners, or other implementations of the Observer pattern. Constrast to library


What are the testing Framework available in java?
Arquillian
JTest
The Grinder
TestNG
JUnit
JWalk
Mockito
Power mock


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG uses test groups, which can categorize tests according to features such as run times.JUnit 4 and TestNG are
similar on the surface.But whereas JUnit is designed to hone in on a unit of code,TestNG is meant for high-level testing.


What are the dependencies for this project?
Dependencies are the relationships of the preceding tasks to the succeeding tasks. Tasks may have multiple preceding
tasks and multiple succeeding tasks. The most common dependency relationship is a finish-to-start relationship. Task
P (predecessor) must be finished before task S (successor) can start.


what is dependency injection in java?
In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the
dependencies of another object. ... In Java, before we can use methods of other classes, we first need to create the
object of that class (i.e. class A needs to create an instance of class B)



What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding uses Type information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve binding. Overloaded
 methods are resolved (deciding which method to be called when there are multiple methods with same name) using static
 binding while overridden methods using dynamic binding, i.e, at run time
